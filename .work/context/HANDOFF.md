# HANDOFF - session boundary

> **This is a template file.** In your adopter repo it is rewritten by **`@session-control start`** / **`@session-control close`** every session. In this framework repo it stays as a demo skeleton so pointer links resolve.

## Session status

**Closed:** 2026-06-23 — Strengthened `@ai-director` and `@x-director` free-text intake contracts; wired directors into `.cursorrules`, `START_HERE.md`, `PROCESS_ROUTER.md`, `README.md`, and `context/README.md`; corrected self-hosted path references in `.cursorrules`.

**Updated:** 2026-06-23

**Repository state:** Agent OS framework repo (self-hosted). Director skills now expose a clear free-text intake contract (capture → load → classify → channel → record). All entry-point docs route free-text requests to `@ai-director` (Agent OS) or `@x-director` (cross-framework). Self-hosted `.cursorrules` path references now point to repo-root framework files. `scripts/framework-verify.sh` local recovery still pending in Trash.

**Recommended pick-up file:** `.work/plans/NEXT.md`

**Lost or new?** Read `START_HERE.md` (from repo root).

## Fresh start - what the next session should do first

1. Run **`@session-control start`** (or follow the manual list in `session-control` skill).
2. Read **`.cursorrules`**.
3. Read **P0 initial scope** when present: `.work/plans/foundation/*-01-*-initial-scope.md`.
4. Read **this file** through §Fresh start, then §Open owner actions.
5. Read `.work/plans/NEXT.md`.
6. Read `.work/plans/ASSUMPTIONS.md`, `RISK_REGISTRY.md`, `UNKNOWNS.md`.

End with **`@session-control close`** (add `commit` / `commit push` only when requested).
