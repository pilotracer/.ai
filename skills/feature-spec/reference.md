## Invocation examples

### Cursor

```
@feature-spec create — fiscal-pipeline
@feature-spec review — .work/features/fiscal-pipeline/20260517-SPEC.md
@feature-spec amend — .work/features/commercial-documents/20260517-SPEC.md
@feature-spec status — master-data

```

### Claude Code / opencode / Codex

Follow .ai/skills/feature-spec/skill.md — create — fiscal-pipeline.
```

```
Follow .ai/skills/feature-spec/skill.md — review — .work/features/master-data/20260517-SPEC.md.
```

## Mode comparison

| | create | review | amend | status | approve |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Read FEATURE_STANDARD | yes | yes | yes | no | yes (via review) |
| Write SPEC | yes | no | no | no | header only |
| Write amendment | no | no | yes | no | no |
| Check §15 registry | yes | yes | no | yes | yes |
| ADR alignment check | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes |
| Completion checklist | yes | yes | yes | no | no |

## SPEC path convention

```
{FEATURE_SPEC_ROOT}/<slug>/YYYYMMDD-SPEC.md
```

Examples for this repo (`.work/features/`):
- `.work/features/fiscal-pipeline/20260517-SPEC.md`
- `.work/features/master-data/20260517-SPEC.md`
- `.work/features/commercial-documents/20260517-SPEC.md`
- `.work/features/peripherals/20260517-SPEC.md`
- `.work/features/synthetic-fixtures/20260517-SPEC.md`
- `.work/features/inbound-reception/20260517-SPEC.md`

Amendment filenames:
```
{FEATURE_SPEC_ROOT}/<slug>/YYYYMMDD-SPEC-amendment-NN-<short-slug>.md
```

## Edge cases

| Situation | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| SPEC exists but is Draft | Review returns `needs-revision` until all §3 sections filled |
| §15 missing at approve | Approve blocked until §15 filled or N/A justified per concept id |
| Approved SPEC has defect | Use **amend** — never edit the Approved SPEC in place |
| Single reviewer on fiscal SPEC | Flag in review; gate blocks approve unless ADR/owner waives |
| Slug collision with another SPEC | Block create; suggest distinguishing slug (e.g. `fiscal-xml-signing` vs `fiscal-pipeline`) |
| FEATURE_STANDARD path moved | Read `.ai/standards/` for latest `*FEATURE_STANDARD*` by date prefix |
| No concept pack in repo | §15 required anyway; mark each MOD row `N/A — no pack` with reason |
| §2 Out of scope empty | Review fails — must be explicit, not `TBD` |

---

## Integration with other skills

| Skill | When |
|-------|------|
| `concept-run list` | Filling §15 concept registry during create |
| `plan-foundation` P3 | Authoring SPECs as part of foundation phase |
| `code-implementation` | Reads Approved SPECs before implementing tasks in that context |

---

## Anti-patterns

- Editing an Approved SPEC in place instead of creating an amendment.
- Approving without §15 filled (even if grandfather-clause is used, document it).
- Creating a SPEC with no ADR links when architectural decisions exist.
- Using `@feature-spec create` for a context already covered by an existing SPEC.

## Wrong prompts

| Prompt | Problem | Use instead |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `@feature-spec create —` (no slug) | No target | Provide a kebab-case slug |
| `@feature-spec create — master-data` (duplicate) | SPEC already exists | `@feature-spec amend` or `review` |
| Editing SPEC after Approved without amend | Violates immutable rule | `@feature-spec amend — <path>` |
| Marking SPEC Implemented in this skill | Wrong stage | `code-implementation complete` updates status |
