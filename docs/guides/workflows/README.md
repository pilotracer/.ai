# Workflow guides

> **Lost or unsure what to invoke?** Open [`.ai/START_HERE.md`](../../../START_HERE.md) — it answers "what do I do right now?" in ≤2 minutes. The matrix below is **reference**; START_HERE is the **decision tree**.

This directory holds portable workflow documentation with two filename shapes:

- **`YYYYMMDD-tutorial-<slug>.md`** — step-by-step material aimed at the **operator** (run this, then that).
- **`YYYYMMDD-guide-<slug>.md`** — **reference** or internal-style docs (layers/template, cross-cutting NFR, methodology companions to skills).

**Curriculum (recommended order) and extra narrative:** [20260518-guide-workflows-index.md](20260518-guide-workflows-index.md)

Links to `…/workflows/README.md` land here.

**Matrix scope:** list paths **normatively referenced** by **`.cursorrules`**, **`.ai/skills/*/skill.md`** (and their `reference.md` companions), **`.ai/standards/*.md`**, the **`.ai/concepts/`** workflow (`README` + per-concept `README` / `prompt.md`), the **workflow guides** in this directory, and **custom agent** wrappers only when they defer to the same rules/skills (no parallel “shadow” governance).

The **artifact matrix** below maps **planning** vs **implementation** (plus cross-cutting and operations) for those official layers only.

## Planning and implementation artifact matrix

### Legend — Status

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Binding** | Engineering standard or rule set; code and SPECs must conform. |
| **Living** | Updated often during sessions or iterations; truth drifts if neglected. |
| **Planning** | Strategic or milestone roadmap; versioned, human-approved. |
| **Registry** | Append-only or carefully maintained planning memory (assumptions, risks, unknowns). |
| **Skill** | Executable agent/human workflow (`skill.md` + optional `reference.md`). |
| **Guide** | Process documentation (this folder and linked workflow docs). |
| **Context** | Read when relevant; not changed every sprint. |
| **Application** | Product source, tests, and migrations. |
| **Protected** | Per project rules: do not modify without explicit approval. |

### Legend — Phase (primary)

| Phase | When it matters |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Planning** | Roadmaps, certification, registries, proposals, SPEC/ADR authorship before or between coding pushes. |
| **Implementation** | Iteration execution, code, tests, schema, verify/complete, local stack bring-up. |
| **Both** | Session hygiene, tactical queue, global rules, standards, concepts, SPECs as the contract under test. |
| **Operations** | Approved runbooks and protected infra definitions (read during setup; edits need approval). |

**Paths** below use **example** filenames and layout. In each adopting repo, map rows to your placeholders ([Path bootstrap](20260518-tutorial-path-bootstrap.md)) and `.cursorrules` `REPLACE:` tokens.
